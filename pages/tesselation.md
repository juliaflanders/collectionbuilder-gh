## Tesselation

The word "tesselation" literally refers to tiles: flat shapes that divide a plane. Mathematical ideas about tesselation emphasize the regularity of tiles, their geometrical precision and repetition, and the distinctive types of patterns that are possible with a specific repertoire of shapes and colors. Natural forms also tesselate, or seem to do so when viewed from a particular angle. The "plane" that is tesselated is often arbitrary, an artifact of the viewing angle, a whim or design of the photographer.
