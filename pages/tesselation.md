## Tesselation

The word "tesselation" literally refers to tiles: flat shapes that divide a plane. Mathematical ideas about tesselation emphasize the regularity of tiles, their geometrical precision and repetition, and the distinctive types of patterns that are possible with a specific repertoire of shapes and colors. Natural forms also tesselate, or seem to do so when viewed from a particular angle. The "plane" that is tesselated is often arbitrary, an artifact of the viewing angle, a whim or design of the photographer. 

## Examples

Many living forms have a natural inclination to tesselate, because the shape they take is guided by their search for things like light or nutrients, or by the need to protect the organism. Leaves grow into spaces to capture sunlight; bark forms tiles by cracking while still covering the tree's surface.

Inorganic forms tesselate when a surface is transected by crystal structures, light rays, or rhythmic motion (suc as a wave form).
