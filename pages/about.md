## About The Patternmaker

This is a personal experimental site in which I experiment with ways of discovering and appreciating pattern. 

## About the Author

I am a digital humanities practitioner and amateur photographer. I'm particularly fascinated with the patterns that arise from natural processes of growth and decay, and also from material creative practices (sometimes unintentional or not fully controlled). This collection explores and celebrates those "found patterns" while also serving as a test site for teaching minimal computing approaches.

## About the Platform

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents
